{{md-text text="
`ember-hifi` provides an easy way to manage audio in your ember app with reliable states, useful events, direct controls and a nice API to interact directly with playing and paused sounds.

**A note before we begin:** Don't try to model your audio. Consider audio a piece of metadata to your other models, like a story or a stream. Let `ember-hifi` do the modelling for you!

Keeping that in mind, let's say you've got some POJOs that look like the following:

Let's listen to WNYC FM using that stream mount point. At a minimum, you'll want a way to start and stop the audio.

First, set up a couple actions to integrate with `ember-hifi`.

{{code-snippet name="play1.js"}}

{{md-text text="
`ember-hifi` provides a `play` method that accepts any of the following as the first argument:
* a String
* an Array of strings
* a Promise that resolves to either of the above

For now we'll stick with the simple use case of a `String`, but the other two cases will be reviewed under advanced usage.

Now make a button wired up to your actions:

{{md-text text="
As you can see, `hifi` provides a helpful `isPlaying` attribute you can use to help manage your UI state. But you might have also noticed a slight delay between clicking play and actually hearing some audio from your speakers.

This delay is caused by the network request to start buffering audio. The `isPlaying` attribute updates in time, but the UI is still in the \"paused\" state until the sound actually starts playing. It's accurate, but `hifi` also exposes an `isLoading` attribute you can use for finer grained UI.

{{code-snippet name="play2.hbs"}}

{{play-basic stream=wqxr useLoading=true}}

{{md-text text="
But hold up: those buttons play different audio sources, yet they are tied to each other's state. That's because they are reading off of `hifi`'s `isLoading` and `isPlaying` states without regard to whether or not `hifi` is loading that button's specific audio. As long as a button ties its UI to `hifi`'s state uncondtionally, you'll have this problem.

When you load a piece of audio, `hifi` will update its `currentId` value with the first argument you pass to `play`; typically a url pointing to an audio file or streaming endpoint. There are times when you may need to specify an id for a piece of audio that is not its url; that will be covered in advanced usage.
